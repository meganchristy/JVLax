			<p> St. Mark's Girls JV Lacrosse team's first game of the season against Rivers was a loss by only one point, with the final score being 11-10. Although this was a tough loss, our team still won with our spirit and competition. The first half was very close in score, and continued to be a constant back and forth between goals. The team was able to pull together in the second half, and started making amazing plays, and scoring many goals  With the help of Athena and Blaine on offense, St. Mark's was able to stay in the game with many amazing goals. Both of these players won the starburst award for their outstanding performance. The ending of the game consisted two last minute goals by St. Mark's to tie it up. But with less than a minute on the scoreboard, Rivers made an unfortunate goal to put them in the lead. </p>
