			<p> This was a disappointing game for the team, but we battled hard against Nobles. They came out strong with an early goal and kept attacking off of that momentum. Then, we came into the game and scored a few goals, but not enough to tie them by half time. After a pump up talk from Ms. Morgan and Ms. Berndt, we came out stron in the second half. However, there was a slump after that and Nobles scored the majority of their goals. It was an unfortunate game, but we put up a good fight against a very talented team.</p>
