			<p> Our second game of the season was very close in score against BB&N. We finished the first half with a score of 1-3. After a very inspiring pep talk from Ms. Berndt during half time, we pulled through and worked hard to keep possession of the ball. Defense stayed aggressive throughout the game, and attack did a good job with settling the ball and putting it in the back of the net. Ending the game with a 5-4 win for St Mark's! </p>
