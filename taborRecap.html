			<p> St. Mark's girls lacrosse played a beautiful game against Tabor Academy to end our 6 game losing streak. St. Mark's started off the game well, but Tabor held up a strong fight, especially when they scored twice just minutes before the first half was over. We took lots of shots on net resulting in the halftime score 4-3 with St. Mark's in the lead. This definitely brought up our momentum and we all played our hardest which led to a final score of 9-7. After halftime wanted to settle down on attack, so we ran some of our favorite plays, and even got a goal off of our '20s' play. We St. Mark's was ecstatic on the win and hopes to keep it up through the end of the season. We were happy to return home after the long ride and celebrated with delicious pizza and soda!</p>
