			<p> This past Wednesday, St. Mark's defeated Lawrence by a landslide. In the first half, St. Mark's came out with a decent defense and offense, finishing the half with a solid lead. However, St. Mark's came back even stronger in the second half with better passing and good connections through the midfield. The connections through the midfield allowed for many offensive opportunities, which lead to a high-scoring game for the lions. Furthermore, the brick-wall defense and multiple saves by goalie Taylor kept St. Mark's far in the lead. When the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard read St. Mark's: 14, Lawrence: 5. </p>
